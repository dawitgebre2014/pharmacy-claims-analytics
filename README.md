# Pharmacy Claims Analytics â€“ Cost & Adherence Insights

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow on synthetic pharmacy claims data. It uses SQL and Python to extract key metrics around medication cost and adherence.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze pharmacy claims using SQL and Python
- Engineer features like refill gaps and medication possession ratio (MPR)
- Visualize trends in medication costs and adherence
- Support data storytelling for stakeholders in clinical and PBM settings

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (example queries provided)
- Power BI / Excel (for dashboarding, optional)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files Included
- `pharmacy_claims.csv`: Synthetic pharmacy claims data
- `claims_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with EDA and visualizations
- `sql_queries.sql`: SQL scripts for exploring the data
- `README.md`: Project overview

## Sample Metrics
- Monthly cost trends
- Refill gaps per member
- Member-level MPR distribution

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Open `claims_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run the notebook to explore cost and adherence trends
